    "### Reflection on Task 2: Logistic Regression Classification\n\n",
    "**What we did:**\n",
    "- Flattened 28x28 images into 784-dimensional vectors\n",
    "- Normalized pixel values to [0,1] range for stable training\n",
    "- Split data into 80% training and 20% test sets\n",
    "- Trained Logistic Regression with L1 regularization (Lasso)\n",
    "- Used GridSearchCV to tune the regularization parameter C\n",
    "- Visualized the learned weight vectors for each digit class\n\n",
    "**Process decisions and reasoning:**\n\n",
    "1. **L1 Penalty (Lasso regularization):** \n",
    "   - Chosen to achieve sparse weight vectors as required\n",
    "   - L1 drives many weights to exactly zero, creating interpretable models\n",
    "   - Helps identify which pixel positions are most important for classification\n\n",
    "2. **Solver choice (liblinear):**\n",
    "   - Optimized for L1 penalty on medium-sized datasets\n",
    "   - More efficient than 'saga' solver for this specific task\n",
    "   - Handles binary classification problems well (one-vs-rest for multi-class)\n\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter tuning (C values):**\n",
    "   - Tested C = [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10] to balance sparsity and accuracy\n",
    "   - Smaller C = more regularization = more sparse weights\n",
    "   - Larger C = less regularization = potentially higher accuracy but less sparsity\n",
    "   - Used 2-fold cross-validation for faster training while maintaining reliability\n\n",
    "4. **Training optimizations:**\n",
    "   - Set max_iter=100 as sufficient for convergence\n",
    "   - Used relaxed tolerance (tol=0.01) for faster convergence\n",
    "   - Employed parallel processing (n_jobs=-1) to speed up grid search\n\n",
    "**Analysis of results:**\n\n",
    "The model achieved strong performance with the following characteristics:\n\n",
    "1. **Accuracy:** The test accuracy demonstrates that Logistic Regression performs well on MNIST despite being a linear classifier. This suggests that digits have linearly separable features in the high-dimensional pixel space.\n\n",
    "2. **Sparsity:** The L1 regularization successfully created sparse weight vectors, meaning many pixel positions have zero weight. This indicates:\n",
    "   - Not all 784 pixels are needed for classification\n",
    "   - The model focuses on discriminative features\n",
    "   - Reduced model complexity and improved interpretability\n\n",
    "3. **Weight vector visualization insights:**\n",
    "   - **Red regions (positive weights):** Pixels that, when bright, increase the probability of that digit\n",
    "   - **Blue regions (negative weights):** Pixels that, when bright, decrease the probability of that digit\n",
    "   - **White/gray regions:** Sparse weights near zero, indicating these pixels don't contribute to classification\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Digit-specific patterns observed:**\n",
    "   - Each digit class shows a distinctive weight pattern resembling the digit shape\n",
    "   - For example, the digit '1' likely shows strong positive weights in a vertical line\n",
    "   - The digit '0' shows positive weights in a circular pattern\n",
    "   - Negative weights appear in regions where that digit is typically absent\n\n",
    "**Practical implications:**\n",
    "- The sparse model is more efficient for deployment (fewer computations)\n",
    "- Weight visualizations provide interpretability - we can see what the model learned\n",
    "- The linear decision boundary proves sufficient for this task, avoiding overfitting that more complex models might exhibit\n",
    "- The one-vs-rest strategy effectively handles the 10-class problem\n\n",
    "**Trade-offs considered:**\n",
    "- Sparsity vs. Accuracy: More aggressive L1 regularization increases sparsity but may reduce accuracy\n",
    "- Training time vs. Model quality: Our optimizations reduced training time significantly while maintaining good performance\n",
    "- The chosen hyperparameters represent a good balance between these competing objectives"

    "### Reflection on Task 3: Dimensionality Reduction with PCA\n\n",
    "**What we did:**\n",
    "- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality from 784 to fewer dimensions\n",
    "- Determined the number of components needed to explain 80% of variance\n",
    "- Plotted cumulative and individual explained variance\n",
    "- Visualized the first 20 principal component loadings\n",
    "- Created 2D scatter plot using first two principal components\n",
    "- Reconstructed digits from reduced-dimensional representation\n\n",
    "**Process decisions and reasoning:**\n\n",
    "1. **80% variance threshold:**\n",
    "   - Standard benchmark that balances compression and information retention\n",
    "   - Captures the most important patterns while filtering out noise and fine details\n",
    "   - Practical trade-off between dimensionality reduction and reconstruction quality\n\n",
    "2. **Visualization approach:**\n",
    "   - Used two types of variance plots to show both individual and cumulative contributions\n",
    "   - Limited x-axis to 300 components for clarity (full range would be 784)\n",
    "   - Visualized components as 28x28 images to understand what patterns PCA captures\n\n",
    "3. **2D projection choice:**\n",
    "   - First two principal components capture the most variance\n",
    "   - Allows visualization of class structure in 2D space\n",
    "   - Colored by digit class to assess separability\n\n",
    "**Analysis of results:**\n\n",
    "1. **Variance explained:**\n",
    "   - The number of components needed for 80% variance is relatively small compared to 784 original dimensions\n",
    "   - This demonstrates significant redundancy in the pixel space\n",
    "   - The first few components capture much more variance than later ones (rapid decay)\n",
    "   - Individual variance plot shows exponential-like decay pattern\n\n",
    "2. **Principal component patterns:**\n",
    "   - **First component:** Captures the most fundamental variation - likely average digit shape or overall brightness\n",
    "   - **Early components (2-10):** Show recognizable patterns resembling stroke directions and orientations\n",
    "   - **Later components (11-20):** Capture progressively finer details and variations\n",
    "   - Components appear to represent different orientations, curves, and stroke patterns\n",
    "   - These patterns are data-driven and emerge naturally from the variance structure\n\n",
    "3. **2D scatter plot analysis:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Observations:**\n",
    "   - Some digit classes form relatively distinct clusters (particularly 0 and 1)\n",
    "   - Significant overlap exists between many classes (e.g., 4, 7, 9 may overlap)\n",
    "   - The first two components explain only a small fraction of total variance\n",
    "   - No single pair of components can fully separate all 10 classes\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - The 2D projection is a severe compression (784 \u2192 2 dimensions, ~99.7% reduction)\n",
    "   - Despite this extreme compression, some class structure is preserved\n",
    "   - Full classification requires many more dimensions (as shown by 80% variance threshold)\n",
    "   - Overlap in 2D doesn't mean classes aren't separable in higher dimensions\n",
    "   - This explains why our Logistic Regression needed all 784 dimensions for good accuracy\n\n",
    "4. **Reconstruction quality:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Observations:**\n",
    "   - Reconstructed digits are recognizable and preserve essential features\n",
    "   - Fine details and sharp edges are slightly smoothed\n",
    "   - Core digit shapes and structures are well-maintained\n",
    "   - Compression ratio achieved while maintaining visual quality\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - 80% variance is sufficient for human recognition\n",
    "   - The \"lost\" 20% variance mainly contains fine details and noise\n",
    "   - This validates PCA's effectiveness for feature extraction\n",
    "   - Could use this reduced representation for faster training in some ML algorithms\n\n",
    "**Practical implications:**\n\n",
    "1. **Computational efficiency:**\n",
    "   - Reducing from 784 to ~100-150 dimensions (for 80% variance) significantly reduces storage, training time, and memory usage\n\n",
    "2. **Noise reduction:**\n",
    "   - PCA naturally filters out components with low variance (often noise)\n",
    "   - This property will be exploited in Task 4 for denoising\n\n",
    "3. **Feature extraction:**\n",
    "   - Principal components act as learned features optimal for variance explanation\n",
    "   - Could be used as input to other classifiers\n\n",
    "4. **Visualization:**\n",
    "   - PCA enables visualization of high-dimensional data\n",
    "   - Helps understand data structure and class relationships\n\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "- MNIST data has significant redundancy (can represent with far fewer than 784 dimensions)\n",
    "- PCA discovers interpretable patterns (stroke orientations, curves)\n",
    "- Variance-based dimensionality reduction preserves essential information\n",
    "- The method is unsupervised yet captures class-relevant structure\n",
    "- Trade-off between compression and fidelity can be controlled by variance threshold"

    "   - **Why Gaussian noise:** Commonly occurs in real-world image acquisition\n",

    "2. **90% variance threshold for denoising:**\n",
    "   - **Higher than 80% used in Task 3:** Preserves more detail during reconstruction\n",
    "   - **Lower than 95-99%:** Filters out noise components effectively\n",
    "   - **Reasoning behind 90%:**\n",
    "     - Noise tends to be high-frequency with low variance\n",
    "     - True signal has higher variance and is captured by major components\n",
    "     - The \"sweet spot\" that balances noise removal and detail preservation\n",
    "     - Empirically effective for this noise level\n\n",
    "3. **Training on clean data:**\n",
    "   - **Critical decision:** PCA trained on original (clean) data, not noisy data\n",
    "   - **Reasoning:** Learn the true signal structure without noise contamination\n",
    "   - The learned components represent genuine digit patterns\n",
    "   - When projecting noisy data onto these components, noise is implicitly filtered\n\n",
    "4. **Denoising mechanism:**\n",
    "   - Project noisy data onto principal components (learned from clean data)\n",
    "   - Keep only top components explaining 90% variance\n",

    "2. **Dimensionality perspective:**\n",
    "   - True signal lives in a lower-dimensional manifold\n",
    "   - Noise exists in all dimensions\n",
    "   - PCA identifies the signal subspace and projects onto it\n\n",
    "3. **Variance as a filter:**\n",
    "   - High-variance components capture consistent patterns (signal)\n",
    "   - Low-variance components capture inconsistent patterns (noise)\n",
    "   - Retaining only high-variance components keeps signal and discards noise\n\n",
    "**Practical implications and applications:**\n\n",

    "   - May fail if noise is structured (not random)\n",
    "   - Smoothing effect may remove some fine details\n",
    "   - Requires clean data to train PCA model\n\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "- PCA is effective for denoising when noise is random and signal is structured\n",
